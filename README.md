Paparazzi Frenzy

Welcome to Paparazzi Frenzy! Paparazzi Frenzy is a game based on the classic arcade game Asteroids by Atari, with a modern twist. It is a single player game that allows the end user to move the photographer around the game screen. Instead of a ship shooting lasers at asteroids, as in the original, the photographer will take photos of starlets for cash!

Project Description

Paparazzi Frenzy is based in HTML canvas. The setting is a red carpet event. The starting game screen positions the photographer in the center of the screen. The photographer will be able to move around the canvas to aim his flash bulb at a passing starlet. If he is able to "focus" on the starlet with his camera (simulated by a white laser contacting the top left section of the starlet), then he will capture an image and will be paid. Certain starlets move faster than others, and each starlet's photo is worth different amounts! The photographer must be careful to avoid taking photos of the security guards, as they will cost him money (since he will now need a lawyer for harassment charges). If the photographer comes into contact with a security guard or any of the starlets, the photographer will lose one of three total lives available during the game. There will be one angry starlet to avoid as well, and she will make you lose money!

User Stories

The player will identify if a photo has been snapped correctly by a white box outlined around the starlet. Cash will be added to the wallet.
On the screen is a wallet total amount that will increase by the amount that the starlet's photo is worth.

To win the game, the photographer must earn a total sum of $1,000,000 in the wallet and have at least one life.

The photographer starts with three lives. 

The photographer will lose a life if he/she comes into contact with one of the starlets or a security guard. 

If all three lives are depleted, Game Over will be announced on the screen. 

There is a lives tracker in the upper left corner of the screen above the wallet amount displayed.

Key and Button functionality:

To play the game, the UP arrow controls the movement of the photographer.

The LEFT and RIGHT arrows control the direction of the movement. 

The photographer will shoot flashbulbs to capture photos every time the SPACE bar is pressed.

The RESTART button at the top of the screen will allow the user to replay the game after a win or loss. One click will reset the lives and wallet, and the second click will reload the canvas to begin the game play.

Coming soon:

Music and sound effects will be added to the game functionality for added interaction.

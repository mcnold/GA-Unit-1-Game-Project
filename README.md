# GA-Unit-1-Game-Project

Project Choice
The name of my project is Paparazzi Frenzy. It is a game based on the classic arcade game Asteroids by Atari, with a modern twist. It is a single player game that allows the end user to move the photographer around the game screen. Instead of a ship shooting lasers at asteroids, as in the original, the photographer will take photos of starlets for cash!

Project Description
Paparazzi Frenzy will be based in HTML canvas. The setting is a red carpet event. The game screen will position the photographer in the center of the screen. The photographer will be able to move around the canvas to aim his flash bulb at a passing starlet. If he is able to "focus" on the starlet with his camera (simulated by a white laser), then he will capture an image and will be paid. Certain starlets will move faster than others, and these photos will be worth more cash. The photographer must be careful to avoid taking photos of the security guards, as they will cost him money (since he will now need a lawyer for harassment charges). If the photographer comes into contact with a security guard, he will lose one of three total lives available during the game. There will be one angry starlet to avoid as well, and if you snap her photo she will deplete your money score.
